## To use
Use IntelliJ or another Java IDE with Maven support to import a Maven project.
Select the pom.xml file. If using IntelliJ, the build/run configurations should
automatically appear. In other IDEs, check the .idea/runConfigurations folder
for the command-line args for the build/run configs, or, if you know Maven, you
might just know the commands off the top of your head.
